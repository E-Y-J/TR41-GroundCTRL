# NOVA AI Implementation Summary

## How NOVA AI is Integrated into GroundCTRL

NOVA AI serves as an intelligent virtual assistant within GroundCTRL, providing real-time, context-aware guidance to users as they navigate satellite operations training scenarios. Powered by Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash API, NOVA leverages advanced natural language processing to understand user questions and deliver step-appropriate hints, command explanations, and troubleshooting assistance. The AI is deeply integrated into our mission simulation engine, receiving full context about the current scenario, mission progress, executed commands, satellite telemetry, and specific training steps. This contextual awareness enables NOVA to provide progressive learning support—offering general guidance when users are beginning a task and more detailed assistance when they're stuck—while tracking hint usage to ensure users develop genuine problem-solving skills rather than simply following instructions.

NOVA operates in two distinct modes to maximize accessibility and learning value. **Authenticated Training Mode** provides personalized assistance during active mission scenarios, with full session tracking, progress monitoring, and adaptive hints tailored to each user's learning journey. **Public Help Mode** allows anyone—even unauthenticated visitors—to ask satellite operations questions, with NOVA intelligently searching our help articles and FAQ database to provide informed responses enriched with relevant documentation context. All interactions are stored in Firebase Firestore for analytics and continuous AI improvement, with appropriate rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes for authenticated users, 20 per 5 minutes for anonymous users) to prevent abuse while ensuring genuine learners have unrestricted access. The system implements graceful degradation, automatically falling back to generic but helpful responses if the Gemini API is unavailable, ensuring NOVA remains operational even during API outages. This dual-mode architecture transforms NOVA from a simple chatbot into a comprehensive learning companion that adapts to both structured training scenarios and exploratory help-seeking behavior.
