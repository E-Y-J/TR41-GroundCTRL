# Help Domain Seeders

Seed scripts for populating the GroundCTRL help domain with initial data.

## Collections Seeded

- `help_categories` - 8 categories (Getting Started, Missions, Satellite Operations, etc.)
- `help_articles` - 3 sample articles with rich content
- `help_faqs` - 8 frequently asked questions

## Usage

### Seed All Collections (Recommended)

```bash
node seeders/index.js
```

This runs all seeders in the correct order and maps category IDs to articles/FAQs.

### Seed Individual Collections

```bash
# Categories only
node seeders/helpCategoriesSeeder.js

# Articles only (requires categories to exist)
node seeders/helpArticlesSeeder.js

# FAQs only (requires categories to exist)
node seeders/helpFaqsSeeder.js
```

## Requirements

- Firebase Firestore must be configured
- `.env` file with Firebase credentials
- Collections will be created if they don't exist

## Data Structure

### Categories
- 8 top-level categories
- Each with code, name, description, icon, color
- Ordered by orderIndex

### Articles
- Sample guides, references, and tutorials
- Rich content blocks (paragraphs, headings, code, tables, callouts, steps)
- Linked to categories via `category_id`
- Published status with view counters

### FAQs
- Question/answer pairs
- Linked to categories
- Featured FAQs for homepage
- Tagged for searchability

## Notes

- Seeders use Firestore batched writes (500 doc limit per batch)
- Category IDs are auto-generated by Firestore
- Articles/FAQs use placeholder category IDs that are replaced at seed time
- Running seeders multiple times will create duplicate data
- Consider clearing collections before re-seeding

## Clearing Data

To clear help domain data before re-seeding:

```bash
# Firebase Console > Firestore Database > Delete collections:
# - help_categories
# - help_articles  
# - help_faqs
```

Or use Firebase CLI:
```bash
firebase firestore:delete help_categories --recursive
firebase firestore:delete help_articles --recursive
firebase firestore:delete help_faqs --recursive
```
